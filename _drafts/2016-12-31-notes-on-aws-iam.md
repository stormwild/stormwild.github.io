AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables user management to your AWS account. It allows you to create *users* and *groups* and assign *permissions* to groups.

These permissions specify what users can do within your AWS account.

Users use a different url to access your AWS account and sign in using the username and password you created.

They may also have programmatic access to AWS using access keys.

You can also monitor the activity of each user with AWS.
