In mathematics, the notion of permutation relates to the act of arranging all the members of a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting.

> Alice, Bob and Charlie is *different* from Charlie, Bob and Alice [2]

> permutations, or *all possible ways* of doing something [2]

### Permutations with Repetition [3]

Given a set: `P { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }`

How many ways can we choose any 3 elements from the set? (You can select the same element for each selection)

If `n` is the number of elements in the set, we can always choose `n` possible ways for each selection.

If `r` is the number of selections, the total number of permutations would be `n x n x n...r` number of times or <code>n<sup>r</sup></code>
