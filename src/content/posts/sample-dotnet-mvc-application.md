Created a sample .NET MVC web application with sorting and pagination. The application was a test for my application to a .NET developer position with a local company.

The requirements included being able to display with sorting and pagination a list of hotels. Each hotel may have one or more images.

This application was done in around 4 hours which was the time limit for the task.
