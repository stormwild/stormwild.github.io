## Warmup

Before starting any intense workout, it's crucial to warm up your muscles to prevent injuries. A proper warmup routine can include light cardio exercises like jogging or cycling for 5-10 minutes, followed by dynamic stretches targeting major muscle groups.

## Squat

The squat is a compound exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core. To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, and then return to the starting position by extending your legs.

## Deadlift

The deadlift is a fundamental exercise for building overall strength and muscle mass. It primarily targets the posterior chain, including the hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and traps. To perform a deadlift, start with a barbell on the floor, bend your knees, hinge at the hips, and lift the barbell while keeping your back straight.

## Bench Press

The bench press is a classic exercise for developing upper body strength and muscle mass. It primarily targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. To perform a bench press, lie on a flat bench, grip the barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, lower the barbell to your chest, and then push it back up to the starting position.

## Pullup

Pullups are an excellent exercise for building a strong back and biceps. They target the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and biceps. To perform a pullup, hang from a pullup bar with your palms facing away, engage your back muscles, and pull your body up until your chin is above the bar.

## Dumbbell Rows

Dumbbell rows are a great exercise for targeting the muscles of the upper back, including the rhomboids, trapezius, and rear deltoids. To perform a dumbbell row, place one knee and hand on a bench, hold a dumbbell in the opposite hand, and pull it up towards your chest while keeping your back straight.

## Lunges

Lunges are a compound exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. To perform a lunge, stand with your feet hip-width apart, take a step forward with one leg, lower your body by bending both knees, and then push back up to the starting position.

## Planks

Planks are a great exercise for strengthening the core muscles, including the abs, obliques, and lower back. To perform a plank, start in a pushup position, lower your forearms to the ground, and hold your body in a straight line from head to toe for a specified amount of time.

Remember to always use proper form and start with lighter weights if you're a beginner. Gradually increase the intensity and weight as you progress. Stay consistent with your workouts and combine them with a balanced diet to maximize muscle growth and overall fitness.

## Recommended Rep Ranges

When performing these exercises for muscle growth, it's important to consider the recommended rep ranges. Here are the suggested rep ranges for each exercise:

1. Warmup: Perform 1-2 sets of 10-15 reps with light weights or bodyweight exercises.
2. Squat: Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps with a challenging weight.
3. Deadlift: Perform 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps with a heavy weight.
4. Bench Press: Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps with a moderate weight.
5. Pullup: Perform 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps, adjusting difficulty with assistance or additional weight.
6. Dumbbell Rows: Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps with a moderate weight.
7. Lunges: Perform 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps on each leg with a challenging weight.
8. Planks: Hold the plank position for 30-60 seconds, aiming for 3-4 sets.

Remember, these rep ranges are general guidelines. Adjust the weight and reps based on your fitness level and goals. Always prioritize proper form and listen to your body to prevent injuries.
