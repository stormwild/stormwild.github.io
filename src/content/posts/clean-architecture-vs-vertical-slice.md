Choosing the right architectural pattern is crucial for long-term project success. This post compares two popular approaches in .NET development: **Clean Architecture** and **Vertical Slice Architecture**, based on insights from [From Layers to Features: Exploring Vertical Slice Architecture in .NET](https://medium.com/ascentic-technology/from-layers-to-features-exploring-vertical-slice-architecture-in-net-df1a05fd2fcf) and [Clean Architecture for C#](https://medium.com/@sanchitvarshney/clean-architecture-for-c-e0c6d00270a5).

## Understanding the Architectures

### Clean Architecture (Layered Approach)

**Clean Architecture** organizes code into concentric layers, with business logic at the center and external concerns at the outer layers.

```sh
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    Infrastructure       │  ← Database, APIs, UI
├─────────────────────────┤
│    Application          │  ← Use Cases, Services
├─────────────────────────┤
│    Domain               │  ← Business Logic, Entities
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Or visualized as a Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Clean Architecture Layers"
        Infrastructure[Infrastructure Layer<br/>Controllers, Database, External APIs]
        Application[Application Layer<br/>Use Cases, Services, DTOs]
        Domain[Domain Layer<br/>Entities, Business Rules, Interfaces]
        
        Infrastructure --> Application
        Application --> Domain
    end
    
    style Infrastructure fill:#ffebee
    style Application fill:#e8f5e8
    style Domain fill:#e3f2fd
```

**Key Principles:**

- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Abstraction**: Inner layers define interfaces, outer layers implement them

### Vertical Slice Architecture (Feature-Based)

**Vertical Slice Architecture** organizes code around features or use cases, with each slice containing all the layers needed for that specific functionality.

```sh
┌──────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
│  Feature A │  Feature B │  Feature C │
│ ┌────────┐  │ ┌────────┐  │ ┌────────┐   │
│ │   UI  │  │ │   UI  │  │ │   UI  │   │
│ ├────────┤  │ ├────────┤  │ ├────────┤   │
│ │ Logic │  │ │ Logic │  │ │ Logic │   │
│ ├────────┤  │ ├────────┤  │ ├────────┤   │
│ │  Data │  │ │  Data │  │ │  Data │   │
│ └────────┘  │ └────────┘  │ └────────┘   │
└─────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

Or visualized as a Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Feature A"
        A1[UI Layer]
        A2[Business Logic]
        A3[Data Access]
        A1 --> A2
        A2 --> A3
    end
    
    subgraph "Feature B"
        B1[UI Layer]
        B2[Business Logic]
        B3[Data Access]
        B1 --> B2
        B2 --> B3
    end
    
    subgraph "Feature C"
        C1[UI Layer]
        C2[Business Logic]
        C3[Data Access]
        C1 --> C2
        C2 --> C3
    end
    
    style A1 fill:#e1f5fe
    style A2 fill:#f3e5f5
    style A3 fill:#e8f5e8
    style B1 fill:#e1f5fe
    style B2 fill:#f3e5f5
    style B3 fill:#e8f5e8
    style C1 fill:#e1f5fe
    style C2 fill:#f3e5f5
    style C3 fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Key Principles:**

- **Feature Cohesion**: Related code stays together
- **Minimal Coupling**: Features are largely independent
- **End-to-End Ownership**: Each slice owns its complete workflow

### Structure and Implementation

```csharp
// Domain Layer - Core business logic
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; private set; }
    public string Email { get; private set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; private set; }
    
    public void UpdateEmail(string email)
    {
        // Business rules and validation
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(email))
            throw new DomainException("Email cannot be empty");
            
        Email = email;
    }
}

// Application Layer - Use cases and orchestration
public class CreateUserUseCase
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
    
    public async Task<User> ExecuteAsync(CreateUserRequest request)
    {
        var user = new User(request.Email);
        await _userRepository.SaveAsync(user);
        await _emailService.SendWelcomeEmailAsync(user.Email);
        return user;
    }
}

// Infrastructure Layer - External concerns
public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    
    public async Task SaveAsync(User user)
    {
        _context.Users.Add(user);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
```

## Vertical Slice Architecture Deep Dive

### Structure and Implementation

```csharp
// Features/Users/CreateUser/
// All code for CreateUser feature in one slice
namespace Features.Users.CreateUser
{
    // Request/Response
    public record CreateUserRequest(string Email);
    public record CreateUserResponse(int Id, string Email);
    
    // Handler - Contains all logic for this feature
    public class CreateUserHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateUserRequest, CreateUserResponse>
    {
        private readonly IDbContext _context;
        private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
        
        public async Task<CreateUserResponse> Handle(CreateUserRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            // Validation
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(request.Email))
                throw new ValidationException("Email is required");
            
            // Business logic
            var user = new User { Email = request.Email, CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow };
            
            // Data access
            _context.Users.Add(user);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
            
            // Side effects
            await _emailService.SendWelcomeEmailAsync(user.Email);
            
            return new CreateUserResponse(user.Id, user.Email);
        }
    }
    
    // Controller - Minimal, just routes to handler
    [ApiController]
    public class CreateUserController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly IMediator _mediator;
        
        [HttpPost("/users")]
        public async Task<CreateUserResponse> CreateUser(CreateUserRequest request)
        {
            return await _mediator.Send(request);
        }
    }
    
    // Validation - Feature-specific rules
    public class CreateUserValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateUserRequest>
    {
        public CreateUserValidator()
        {
            RuleFor(x => x.Email).NotEmpty().EmailAddress();
        }
    }
}
```
