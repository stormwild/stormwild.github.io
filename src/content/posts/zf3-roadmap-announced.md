The Zend Framework team recently announced the [ZF3 roadmap](http://framework.zend.com/blog/announcing-the-zend-framework-3-roadmap.html).

The plans for ZF3 include:

* Separating components into individual, versioned projects. This enables broader re-use and higher velocity of innovation.
Strong emphasis on HTTP messages, with Matthew leading the PSR-7 specification.

* Updating our existing full-stack MVC framework to depend on the newly independent components for better reuse and simplicity. ZF2 MVC applications will have a documented upgrade path to ZF3 requiring minimal changes.

* Embracing middleware runtime patterns as a lighter weight alternative to the enterprise MVC framework stack.
Enabling Apigility to work as a middleware stack, for better performance and simplicity, with the same streamlined, powerful user experience.

* Optimizing for PHP 7, but supporting PHP 5.5 onwards.
