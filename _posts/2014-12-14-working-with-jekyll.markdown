title: Working With Jeykyll
---

It's been a bit of a struggle for me to finally be able to get a hang of Jekyll. I hope to learn more about how to use it as my main profile site.

I just learned that I had to use Liquid templating to get code highlighting.

{% highlight ruby %}
def what?
  42
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight csharp %}
public class Test 
{
    private string gretting = "Hello World.";

    public Test()
    {

    }

    public string Greeting { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}
