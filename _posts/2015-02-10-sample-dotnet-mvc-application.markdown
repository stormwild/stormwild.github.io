title: BCSHotels - A Sample C# .NET MVC5 Application
---

Created a sample .NET MVC web application with sorting and pagination. The application was a test for my application to a .NET developer position with a local company.

The requirements included being able to display with sorting and pagination a list of hotels. Each hotel may have one or more images.

The source code of the application is available on [Github](https://github.com/stormwild/BCSHotels)

While a demo is deployed on [Azure websites](http://bcshotels.azurewebsites.net/)
