[The Hacker News](http://thehackernews.com/) reported [Zero Day exploits found in PHP7](http://thehackernews.com/2016/12/php-7-update.html).

> The critical vulnerabilities reside in the unserialized mechanism in PHP 7 – the same mechanism that was found to be vulnerable in PHP 5 as well, allowing hackers to compromise Drupal, Joomla, Magento, vBulletin and PornHub websites and other web servers in the past years by sending maliciously crafted data in client cookies.[1]

> unserialize is a dangerous function. It has been proven over and over in the last years, yet it is still used in the wild. [2]
